### Info

Project was created as an example of running python script as child process module.

To run, you'll need nodejs, python and [PIP](https://docs.docker.com/install/)) installed.

Once that is installed, run

```
npm run prestart
npm run start
```

You will be asked to enter path for temporary file storage. You can enter it in newly created /config.json file. Optionally, you can enter max file size (in bytes, default 5000000) and max size for image (default x,y 4000).
